# Pixel Baseband Research

This repository contains code for researching the firmware images of Samsung baseband
chips used in the 6th and 7th generation Google Pixel devices.

These scripts mostly allow some insight into the Pixel modem configuration stored under
`/vendor/firmware/carrierconfig`, but may be relevant for general reverse engineering
of the Samsung Shannon modems.
